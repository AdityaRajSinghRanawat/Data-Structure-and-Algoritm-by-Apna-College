    // What is Recursion?
    /*
        It occurs when a function calls itself, untill hitting the base case.

        [main] -> [abc] -> [abc] -> [abc] -> [abc] /|/ {base case}

        e.g.
        void abc(){
            abc();
        }

        Note:
        The work you can do with the "loops" those can be done with "recursion".

        loops:    to traverse vector/array
        recusion: to solve specific algorithm, tree, graph

        Core Working:
        It solves the small part of big problem, and again the remaining part
        is solved by recursion.

        e.g.
        . [////|                        ]
        .      [////|                   ]
        .           [////|              ]
        .                [////|         ]
        .                     [////|    ]
        .                          [////]  {base case}
