        # Data Type Modifiers:-
        change meaning of data types


        NOTE:- 
        These all will depend on your machine and its memory type (32 or 64 bits)


        1. long:-
        // ensure you get higher memory then usual

        e.g. 
        int = 4 byte
        long int >= 4 byte (it ensure that you get more momory >= 4 bytes) 

     
        2. short:-
        // ensure that you get less memory then usual



        3. long long:-
        // ensure that you get more space



        4. signed:-
        // consider the sign of integer i.e. +ve or -ve

        e.g. 
        Temperature
        Height




        5. unsigned:-
        // do not consider the sign of integer

        e.g.
        customer ID
        bank account Number

        because they are generally positive



        _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .... 32 bits
        ^
        |
        MSB (Most Significant Bit)

        now we do not need to take care of MSB for +ve or -ve number

        now we can use it to store our data
        now we have range
        0 to (2)^32
        now we can store the data double the previous size
